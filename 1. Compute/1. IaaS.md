# Provision Virtual Machines (VM)
design considerations for VMs include
- CPU 
- Memory
- IOPS
we need to choose a compute optimizes (higher ratio of CPU to memory) or a VM that is memory optimized
## High Availabilty
we have three ways to get high Availabilty
### 1. Availabilty Set
Places VM in the different racks in the same datacenter
### 2. Availabilty Zones
VMs are replicated across different data centers in the same region
### 3. Azure Site Recovery
replicates the machines across different regions
# Configure, Validations, and deploy ARM templates
On azure we have 2 different types of operations 
## 1. Control Plane Operations
It is basically the management operations (CRUD Operations)
## 2. Data Plane Operations
specific functionalities exposed by a service (RDP to VM)
## Resource Providers
Resources on azure are oragnised  by Resource Providers and under each resource provider we have a set of control plane and data plane operations

> **Example** : Microsoft.Stroage represents the azure storage resource provider, and under that resource provider we have a set of control plane (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read) operations and data plane operations (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobService/read)

**Most of control plane operations are logged in `activity log`**

## Azure Resource Management (ARM)

All the control plane operations in azure (whether from azure portal or azure sdk or azure cli) goes through the azure resource manager (ARM)

Under each resource providers we have specific operations

### ARM Template 
A declarative way(JSON file) to create azure resources

- `ARM Template` helps to reuse the template for automation of resource operations.
- It is version controlled
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2021-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {}
  "variables": {}
  "resources": [
    {
        "name": "storageaccount1"
        "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
      "apiVersion": "2021-04-01",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "properties": {
        "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {}
}
```
### Multi-tiered Template
we can nest the templates on the parent template.

her we could see each resource has its own template and all the templates are nested inside a parent template.

### Deployment Mode 
#### 1. Incremental

default mode and leaves resources unchanged if they aren't described in the template.

> **Example** : if we create a template for storage account and we already have SQL server,VM in already in the resource group but running the Incremental mode we retain already running resources and creates a storage account 

#### 2. Complete
needs to be specified and if the resource is not in the template it will be deleted 
```powershell
az deployment group create \
    --mode Complete \
```
# Configure container images for Solutions
## Container 
Layer of abstraction above a virtual machine
- lightweight
- packs all dependencies to run same across different environments
- De facto standard for Microservices
```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /usr/src/app 

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["node","server.js"]
```
# Publish images to azure container registry
## Container Registry 
A centralised location to store containers

### Pricing Tiers

**Basic** : Not much included storage and image throughput.Meant for developer workloads.

**Standard** : Provides more storage and image throughput. Meant for production workloads

**Premimum** : Adds features like geo replication and private link support

### Storage Capabilities
- encryption at rest storage
- geo replication of storage to protect loss of images in case of an outage
- limit of storage is 5TB

# Run containers using azure container instances
Serverless way to run container in azure 
## Container Groups
A way to deploy multiple containers in a container group 
## stateful containers
by default azure container are stateless so we can't store session information , we can't write into cache

inorder to do these we can mount the azure file shares to allow containers to persist state (making azure files available to the container)
