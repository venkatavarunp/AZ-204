# Create and Deploy Azure Functions Apps
Azure Functions is a serverless offering on azure that allows to run event driven functions.

Functions are 
- Consumption Based 
- Scales Automatic

## Hosting Plans
### 1. Consumption
- Default option
- Maximum timeout of 10 minutes per function 
- No VNet integration
- Prone to Cold starts (scale down to 0 and takes time to restart)
**When we don't need need features of other tiers**
### 2. Premium
- Predicatable pricing
- No timeout 
- supports VNet integration
- Prewarmed
**Can be used for frequent executions and can access VNet resources**
### 3. Dedicated
- Runs it in a App Service Plan 
- No cold start issues
- No timeouts
**Can be used when Undertilized app service plan and can run azure functions in its own VNet**
## Triggers and Bindings
### Trigger 
Triggers functions and can contain only 1 trigger per function 
### Bindings 
A way to declaratively define inputs and outputs of your azure function

Consider the following examples of how you could implement different functions.

|Example scenario	|Trigger	|Input binding|	Output binding|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|A new queue message arrives which runs a function to write to another queue.	|Queue|	None|Queue*|
|A scheduled job reads Blob Storage contents and creates a new Azure Cosmos DB document.|Timer	|Blob Storage	|Azure Cosmos DB|
|The Event Grid is used to read an image from Blob Storage and a document from Azure Cosmos DB to send an email.|	Event Grid|	Blob Storage and Azure Cosmos DB	|SendGrid|
|A webhook that uses Microsoft Graph to update an Excel sheet.	|HTTP|	None|	Microsoft Graph|
