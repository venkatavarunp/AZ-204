# Create an Azure App Service Web App
PaaS offering by Azure and can help with 
- autoscale
- deployment slots 
- continous deployment 
- ability to host containers 
## App service plan
App services are created under azure app service plan and app services are essentially an environment containing of worker nodes where the applications are actually running and some loadbalancers (frontends).

Azure app service plan defines
- region of application hosted
- no.of VMs 
- Pricing Tier 

### Pricing Tiers

**Shared** : All applications tuns on the same single environment . mostly used for testing 

**Basic/Dedicated** : We get shared networj but dedicated VMs 

Doesn't support autoscale

**Standard** : same as Basic/Dedicated but has autoscaling and Doesn't provide private endpoints

**Premium** : same as Standard but has more VM instances

**Isolated** : Dedicated virtual network and instances.
# Enable Diagnostic Logging
Diagnostic settings is a way to send resource specific logs to azure log analytics, storage account or event hub.

The different types of logs are 
- Application logging
- Web server logging
- Detailed error logging
- Failed Request Tracing
- Deployment logging
# Deployment in azure app service
there are two ways to do it 
## Automated deployment
any time we merge the code to master a deployment occurs from the source control repo 
## Manual deployment
can be deployed using 
- azure cli 
- azip deply using kudo api 
- ftp
- visual studio
### Deployment Slots
the slots where the applications running and it is a unit of deployment

when we swap the staging environment with the production environment we can eliminate application down time

we can have multiple slots based on the service plan and we can route the traffic to the slots

# Configure web app settings including TLS,SSL & API settings and Connection Strings

# Autoscaling
Autoscale helps when machine cant handle the number of requests but doesn't help with resource intense tasks

Autoscale is under the resource provider `microsoft.insights/autoscalesettings/<settingname>` is a rule with the following condition types
- Scale based on a metric 
- scale based on schedule
**We can create multiple conditions and they are treated as OR**
