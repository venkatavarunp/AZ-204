# OAuth 2.0
A way to grant an application access to resources without sharing secrets

we will make use of apps identity platform and we provide login credentials and in reverse we get an access token to the app and then app uses token to post tweets rather than user details 

it helps to login using 3rd party applications without actually sharing the details 
- output form OAuth 2.0 flow is an access token 
- openID was built on top of OAuth 2.0 and output of openID is an identity token
- it helps in outsourcing Authentication and Authorisation to the 3rd party services instead of maintaing AD, Database and security overhead
