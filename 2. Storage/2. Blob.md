A blob is an unstructured data like PDFs, files,logs, images, videos, etc cheaper than azure files

Blob are stored in storage accounts

# Moving Blobs Around
Azure allows us to copy blobs to move them around and these are achieved by 
- Azure CLI (uses `az storage copy` and is asynchronous)
- `AzCopy` (provides more features than azure CLI, restarts can be configured and performance can be tuned to local machine)
- .NET storage library (Programmatic way to move blobs around but requires coding)
# Blob metadata
## System Defined
configured under the covers includes last modififed time, public access level, etc 

can be used as a part of applications and policies
# User Defined 
key value pairs set on container or blob

`BlobContainerClient` is the main class which allows us to create a blob or containers

# Blob Lifecycle and Policies 
## Blob Access Tiers
- **Hot** : pay more for storage and less for usage
- **Cold** : pay more for usage, less for storage
- **Archive** : used for storing data that is rarely accessed and there will be delay in retrieving the data.
we can manage the Lifecycle of these blobs from one tier to another

we can have different policies under certain conditions we can place blobs from the hot access tier to cold and viceversa
