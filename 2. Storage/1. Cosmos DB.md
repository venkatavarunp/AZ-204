# Azure Cosmos DB
A general purpose NOSQL Managed Database that is globally distributed

It has four data model families
- Key, Value 
- Documents
- Graph
- Column, Family

Documents stored in strucutured BISON (binary JSON) format with full inforced schema 

Column Family data model uses CQL and doesn't enforce schema as SQL

# Appropriate API and SDK for a solution
**1. SQL API** : Native to azure and stores data in documents , uses SQL language to query the data 

**2. MongoDB API** : stores in documents

**3. Cassandra API** : stores in column oriented data

**4. Gremlin API** : stores in graph format data

**5. Table API** : stores in key-value pair data and uses azure storage table api

containers can be seen as tables in SQL DB

inside containers we have items (same as rows in SQL DB tables)

**The data in the container are logically placed across different Paritions based on Parition keys**

Parition keys helps with easy querying 

Autoscale works on the containers via Paritions
# Set the appropriate consistency level for operations
## Consistency Levels 
**1. Strong** : guarantees consistency as the data is replicated synchronously to replicas

**2. Bounded** : Reads might lag behind write (we can define the lag)

**3. Session** : A writer in a session is always guaranteed to read the same data they wrote, and will never read a stale version from an out of date replica while everyone else (outside session) may experience bad reads 

**4. Consistent Prefix** : guarantees that read never see out of order writes

**5. Eventual** : offers no guarantee in consistency but we get best latency 

# Change Feed 
azure cosmos DB exposes certain events to outside world and we can use those events in application logic and make use of events in the application
